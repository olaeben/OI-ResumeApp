# Resume App

A Swift application that highlights my skills and professional experiences. The app allows users to expand or collapse different sections, such as skills and experiences, through interactive buttons with animated chevrons.
This project uses XCUITest for UI testing and follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for better maintainability.
